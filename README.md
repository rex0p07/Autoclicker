This code uses the pyautogui and threading modules to simulate mouse clicks at two different positions.

The code defines the x and y coordinates of the two positions to click, as well as the delay between clicks in milliseconds.

The code then defines two functions, "click1" and "click2", to simulate mouse clicks at the corresponding positions using the pyautogui.click() method. These functions use a while loop and a time.sleep() method to simulate continuous clicking with the given delay.

Finally, the code creates two threads using the threading.Thread() method and assigns the "click1" and "click2" functions as targets for these threads. The threads are then started using the .start() method.

Overall, this code is an example of how threading can be used to simulate continuous mouse clicks at multiple positions using the pyautogui module. However, it is important to note that the use of this code could potentially violate the terms of service or acceptable use policies of certain applications or services, and could result in actions being taken against the user.
